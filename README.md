# loc_bittrex_v3.py
Bittrex announced that it was retiring the Bittrex API 1.1 in September 2020 (3 months), and encouraged us to switch to the new 3.0 API.  I had been using a modified version of ericsomdahl's python-bittrex.  I don't have time to figure out how to properly use github to properly fork that project to post the code that I got working to use the new requests.  This project works with the new Bittrex REST API 3.0.  With the following caveats the "get conditional orders" appears to want the trade symbols reversed to the old order (ie USD-BTC) vs the new Forex style (BTC-USD).  In addition the old python-bittrex calls are now multiple calls to the new API, so there is no direct correlation.  My own personal private project (trading bot) which requires this library is going to need a significant overall, and this was just the first step to get that project going...  I apologize for not posting this in the correct 'git' way, but from my own fruitless searching I could tell that others are probably in the same boat as me and decided to get it out there.  If there wasn't a rampant virus, family health emergencies, and a full time job to deal with, I would have taken the time to do this right. Good Luck.
